<h2>Built for Chicago</h2>
<p>Our custom metal fabrication designs account for snow load, freeze–thaw cycles, and thermal expansion typical in Chicago and the greater Chicago area. This ensures assemblies stay secure and perform reliably year‑round.</p>

<p>We prioritize repeatable quality and accurate lead times. Each assembly is checked against drawings before packaging, and templated patterns for common roof interfaces reduce site risk. When the weather turns, reliable assemblies matter.</p>
